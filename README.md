# Miscellaneous Scripts

## Warning

This repository contains miscellaneous scripts that does not fit in one repository, yet I will use them sometimes for my personal use. Note that some of the scripts might contain *hardcoded paths* and opinionated *presets*, and you are advised to inspect them before actually using.

## What are these folders for?

Here are the list of some folders that I think can be used by the general public, or I am interested telling you what is it about:

* [`hku-examinations`](./ungrouped/)
  * Analyze the list of enrolled courses that has examinations by HKU students.
  * [For more information, click here.](./hku-examinations/README.md)
* [`ungrouped`](./ungrouped/)
  * As the name implies, random scripts I place here for whatever purposes. Some of the notable examples are:
  * [`gradientdescent.py`](./ungrouped/gradientdescent.py): Help me do my `APAI1001` assignments
  * [`download-ges.js`](./ungrouped/download-ges.js): Download [HKU Graduate Employment Survey](https://www.cedars.hku.hk/careers/graduate-employment-survey/statistics-of-a-specific-programme/) by ***batch***
