# Miscellaneous Scripts

## Warning

This repository contains miscellaneous scripts that does not fit in one repository, yet I will use them sometimes for my personal use. Note that some of the scripts might contain *hardcoded paths* and opinionated *presets*, and you are advised to inspect them before actually using.

## What are these folders for?

Here are the list of some folders that I think can be used by the general public, or I am interested telling you what is it about:

* [`hku-examinations`](./ungrouped/)
  * Analyze the list of enrolled courses that has examinations by HKU students.
  * [For more information, click here.](./hku-examinations/README.md)
* [`ungrouped`](./ungrouped/)
  * Random scripts that I haven't come up with an idea on how to pack them yet
  * [`gradientdescent.py`](./ungrouped/gradientdescent.py): Help me do my `APAI1001` assignments
  * [`download-ges.js`](./ungrouped/download-ges.js): Download [HKU Graduate Employment Survey](https://www.cedars.hku.hk/careers/graduate-employment-survey/statistics-of-a-specific-programme/) by ***batch***
* [`tex`](./tex/)
  * My $\LaTeX{}$ template used for school assignments, no more handwriting $\sigma \ \phi \ \theta \ \alpha \ \epsilon \ \varepsilon \ \vartheta \ \rho$!
  * Feel free to copy&use it! (*star* this repo if you done it)
* [`yt-dlp`](./yt-dlp/)
  * Do your friends want to download youtube videos without using online services?
  * They don't know how to install `python` and `yt-dlp` (or `youtube-dl`)?
  * Use this script (on Windows `Command Prompt`) to package `yt-dlp` with `pyinstaller`, and let your friends download video via `./yt-dlp.exe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` terminal command!
