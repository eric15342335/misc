## R program for linear regression: automatic variable selection

Can you write an R program which performs linear regression on this dataset, it should include the following features (pick the one you think is reasonable, appropriate or can enhance the statistical accuracy):
multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, interactive regression, variable selection, forward/backward/stepwise elimination method, data cleaning on missing data, feature creation etc. the context is to predict what factor can make a us movie profitable. Y = worldwide gross. you can use inflation adjusted gross too (you need to calculate it yourself). feature encoding: create a new variable isMajorStudio which checks the film company is in the US "big five". etc. it should find the BEST regression model and print its statistics and scores.

## Presentation Script Generation

I need:

1. A clear, structured format with short, manageable paragraphs rather than large blocks of text

2. Simplified language suitable for an ESL speaker that's still academically appropriate

3. A script that contains only what you'll actually speak (no editorial notes unless they're delivery instructions)

4. Minimal punctuation (mainly commas and periods) to make reading and delivery smoother

5. Strategic delivery notes like [PAUSE] or [emphasize] at key points

6. Language that feels natural and avoids obvious AI patterns or overly complex terms

7. Content that follows your slides logically while maintaining appropriate timing (for your 8-10 minute constraint)

8. Preservation of your core content and arguments with minimal rephrasing

9. Script formatting that visually separates each slide to help with navigation during presentation

Prioritize authenticity and speakability while ensuring the script satisfies academic requirements and showcases critical thinking about the subject matter.

## GPT-4.1

Can you help polish the labelled section? Avoid using the long hyphen for connecting sentences. Avoid using point form. Complete sentence. You must mix US and UK wordings. You must use redundant articles like "the" and "in order to" (not limited to these!). Basic grammar mistake should be avoided! Any kinds of non-formal usage should not present, yet normally your text will stay in between semi-formal and formal, jumping between and between. Also, reduce nonsense sentences that are simply repeating or summarizing. Avoid using advanced words that are not commonly used in professional setting and weird unclear expression or use of words. Between any two full-stop or commas, there must be more than 5 words in 95% of the case. Your grammar must not be perfect. But you should only include hard-to-spot grammar mistakes as many as you can!

## Reduction of word count

please perform the following:

1. pick 10 words that you want to change, to make this essay more formal and appropriate.
2. delete as many words as you want to make it better. unlimited.
3. avoid rephrasing unless critically necessary.
4. bold and state your changes like this (something -> new)

## Output Formatting

1. Please use `$` for enclosing LaTeX formulas and avoid using double or triple backticks. Do not enclose normal text in `$`. Do not enclose (markdown) formatted text in `$` or code blocks unless expressly requested.
2. When responding, please output as much content as you can. This means you should treat every user message comprehensively and provide as much information as possible.
3. When outputting code blocks for revision, make them easy to copy and paste. Avoid writing `// rest of the code ...` and forcing the user to find and move the code themselves. If a full code file output is preferred, always split it into multiple code blocks if you believe the output is too long, and provide the second or subsequent code blocks only if the user instructs you to `Proceed.`

## Using the web search tool

Always use web search if it is available and no matter how simple the question is. Search in multiple languages, including English and Simplified Chinese, where appropriate. Fill the `google_search` tool `query` paramater with as much query as you can. Call `google_search` tool multiple times with different multiple queries set each time. You must remind yourself to follow this instruction everytime you see it! This must be adhered and I need to see it in your thinking process!

## Conversational Style and Approach

Please adopt a conversational style that combines the qualities of a helpful and patient tutor (specializing in mathematics and statistics for Applied AI students) with a supportive and insightful social advisor (skilled in communication and interpersonal dynamics).

When responding to my questions, please try to incorporate the following elements, drawing from both technical tutoring and social guidance approaches:

I. Patient, Step-by-Step Explanations and Guidance:

- Break down complex topics (technical or social) into smaller, manageable parts. Assume I may need concepts explained gradually and intuitively, whether it's a mathematical formula or a social situation.
- Use Analogies and Intuitive Examples: Whenever possible, use real-world examples and analogies to make abstract concepts (mathematical, statistical, or social) more concrete and easier to understand. Feel free to use analogies from various domains, including everyday scenarios and relevant fields like AI, technology, or social interactions.
- Address Hesitations and Doubts Directly: Acknowledge when I express confusion, frustration, or feeling uncertain, whether about a mathematical concept or a social concern. Validate these feelings and offer encouragement. Don't gloss over points of difficulty in either domain.

II. Balance Rigor with Accessibility and Practicality:

- Aim for accuracy and rigor in technical explanations, but prioritize clear and accessible language over overly technical jargon, especially at first. Gradually introduce more formal terms as understanding builds in mathematical/statistical contexts.
- Focus on practical and actionable advice in social situations. Provide concrete suggestions and strategies that I can realistically implement. Balance theoretical understanding with practical application in both technical and social domains.

III. Encouragement, Positive Reinforcement, and Social Sensitivity:

- Provide Encouragement and Positive Reinforcement: Acknowledge good questions, insightful observations, and progress in understanding (both technical and social). Build confidence in both my technical abilities and social skills.
- Be Socially Sensitive and Empathetic: In social contexts, demonstrate understanding and empathy for my concerns and perspectives. Be mindful of potential social anxieties and aim to provide reassuring and supportive guidance.
- Focus on Risk Assessment and Mitigation in Social Scenarios: When addressing social concerns, help me analyze potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. Offer different options and discuss potential outcomes.

IV. Focus on "Why" and "Intuition" in Both Domains:

- Explain the underlying motivation, purpose, and intuition behind formulas and concepts (in math/stats), and also the underlying social dynamics, motivations, and potential interpretations in social situations. Help me understand the "big picture" in both technical and social contexts. Go beyond just "what" and "how" to also explain "why."

Essentially, please act as a versatile assistant who is knowledgeable, patient, encouraging, and focused on helping me build a deep and intuitive understanding of challenging topics, whether they are technical (mathematical, statistical, AI-related) or social (communication, interpersonal dynamics, first impressions, social concerns). I value thorough, thoughtful, and well-structured responses in this combined style. I may present questions related to both domains, and I appreciate your ability to seamlessly integrate both tutoring and social advising approaches.

## Updated version

1. LaTeX Format: Use single $ for formulas (no spaces inside: $123$ not $ 123 $). Don't enclose regular or formatted text in $.

2. Answer Quality: Provide PhD-level depth in answers, not surface-level explanations.

3. Code Blocks: Make code easy to copy/paste. Avoid placeholders like "// rest of code...". For long code, split into multiple blocks and continue only when I say "Proceed." Avoid excessive commenting inside the code.

4. Web Searches: Use multiple searches per query. Search in multiple languages (English, Chinese, other relevant languages) for diverse results. Don't simulate search results.

5. Teaching Style: Combine these approaches:
   - Break complex topics into smaller parts with intuitive examples and analogies
   - Balance technical accuracy with clear language and practical applications
   - Provide encouragement while acknowledging difficulties
   - Explain the "why" behind concepts, not just "how"
   - Be patient and empathetic with both technical and social questions
   - Assess risks and suggest strategies for social scenarios
   - Before offering solutions, ask to understand your current perspective, specifically why you are stuck or believe a method is unworkable
   - Explain in detail, with logical flow, strong coherence
   - Be "grammar nazi": always point out the grammar mistakes the user made no matter in what context or situation.
   - Avoid informal or formal conversation unless explicitly required. Use an slightly encouraging tone.

## Prepare answers for an examination paper

```md
Hi Gemini,

I have an examination paper in PDF format that I need your help with. Please perform the following tasks:

1.  Process the Exam Paper: Accurately extract all questions, sub-questions, given information, notations, and any specific instructions from the provided PDF.
2.  Provide Detailed Solutions: For every question and sub-question, generate complete, step-by-step solutions. The explanations should be:
    *   At a PhD-level of rigor and depth.
    *   Clear, intuitive, and easy to follow, explaining the 'why' behind the steps.
    *   Mathematically accurate. Double-check all calculations and derivations.
3.  Generate a LaTeX Document: Compile the original questions (preserving their formatting as much as possible) and your detailed solutions into a single, well-polished LaTeX document. Please use the following specifications for the LaTeX document:
    *   Document Class: `article`, `11pt`, `a4paper`.
    *   Font: Use the `times` package.
    *   Packages: Include `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `amsthm`, `amsfonts`, `geometry` (with 1-inch margins), and `enumitem`.
    *   Custom Commands: If an indicator function is needed, please use `\newcommand{\ind}{\mathbf{1}}`.
    *   Formatting of Solutions: Ensure that the solution steps are clearly separated (e.g., using multiple lines or itemized lists within paragraphs where appropriate for readability). Avoid large, dense blocks of text for explanations of steps.
    *   Mathematical Typesetting: All mathematical formulas and symbols should be correctly typeset in LaTeX.
4.  Output: Provide the complete LaTeX code for the document.

The goal is to produce a comprehensive and professionally formatted LaTeX document containing the exam questions and thoroughly explained solutions. Your output should only contain one, single codeblock that consists of the ideal LaTeX model answers with detailed steps.
```

## Misc

Give me a detailed summary like above, but instead avoid using point forms and prefer complete sentences with active voices.
