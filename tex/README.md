## Prompt for AI models like `o1-mini` and `o1-preview`

I am a university professor preparing assignments for my students. I have uploaded a PDF file containing the questions for which I need model answers. Your task is to:  

1. Provide the model answers as a LaTeX document, adhering strictly to the provided LaTeX template.  
2. Ensure the output is a code block containing the final LaTeX code only, without extraneous commentary or formatting.  
3. Use LaTeX-compatible syntax exclusively. Avoid non-LaTeX syntaxes like Markdown (e.g., `#` for headings).  

Key Instructions:  

* The provided LaTeX template includes several user-defined commands:  
  * `\mysectionstar` for questions.  
  * `\mysubsectionstar` for subquestions.  
  * `\mysubsubsectionstar` for subsubquestions.  
  Use these consistently to structure the document.  
* Provide rigorous, well-thought-out model answers for the questions.  
* Where calculations are required, perform them to the best of your ability. If precise values are needed or rounding is required, calculate them but include a disclaimer that the accuracy may be limited due to the inherent limitations of the AI model.  
* Structure the answers step by step, ensuring clarity and correctness. Verify the reasoning and approach before finalizing each part.  
* Be meticulous with mathematical and textual formatting, ensuring readability and alignment with LaTeX standards.  

Key Objectives:  

* Deliver a professional, rigorously structured LaTeX file suitable for direct use in academic settings.  
* Think carefully and methodically before writing each answer to ensure logical consistency and academic rigor.
